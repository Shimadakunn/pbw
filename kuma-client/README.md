Chain abstraction\
Multi Wallet abstraction\
Protocol aggregator and abstraction (AAVE...)\
Multichain Swap\

Send funds to address

## Getting Started

Connect to Kuma using one of the proposed social login\
Then fund your wallet with some testnet token\
For DAI USDC EURS WETH and WBTC, use AAVE faucet on https://app.aave.com/faucet/ \
To create a Starknet wallet, you need to fund in ETH the address given to you in the toast on https://faucet.goerli.starknet.io/ \
You are ready to use it!

Matic DAI USDC EURS WETH WBTC on Polygon Mumbai\
AVAX on Avalanche Fuji\
SOL on Solana Devnet\
XTZ on Tezos Testnet\
STRK on Starknet Goerli

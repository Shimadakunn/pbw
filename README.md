# Kuma
[Kuma App](https://kuma-paw.vercel.app/)

[Octane Server API](https://octane-server-one.vercel.app/api)
## Motivation
In order to make the blockchain accessible for everybody and include anyone in our ecosystem, we develop a dapp that let user has an CEX ui experience with the advantages of non-custodial Wallet

## Main Features
- Social Login
- Chain Abstraction
- Fee Abstraction (With Octane on Solana)

## How does it work
Using Octane, we implemented the possibilty to create a Gas Tank in which the user can top up fee credits that he wants to have in order to pay his gas in a Normal token, without the need to necesserly have SOL.
This allows us to abstract fees and unify the currency for gas and link them between each chain i.e pay fees on all chain with USDC

## What coming next?
Link all the gas tank with wormhole in order to be launched and have a smooth user experience that every body dreamed about
